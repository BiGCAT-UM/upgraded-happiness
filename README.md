# Research Output Types

A grassroots project to make an overview of how scholars really want to be evaluated

Currently, researchers are predominantly assessed by the number of journal articles, books, and book chapters.
But modern science results in many more research output types. Sadly, these are commonly disregarded in
Recognition and Rewarding, as if doing them was not important. You can think about data sets, scientific
software, theoretical and computational models, project deliverables.

Of course, not all of these outputs have the same nature. Some are release soon (think, open notebook science),
some are peer reviewed. For example, impactful scientific software often has seen magnitudes more peer
review than a typical journal article. That does not make sense to me.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to identify what research output we want to be assessed on ourselves. The idea
here is that the researchers have had years of training in their domain to decide how research can be
best communicated and disseminated. This differs for every domain, but settling for the the most common
approach that applies to all domains is out of this world.

## Tasks

This project is an open approach with the above goal. And there are some clear tasks:

1. we need a reasonable list of domains (that sounds a lot easier than it is; I cannot rule out a multivariate approach)
2. we need a reasonable list of research output types
3. we need a reasonable list of characteristics (moment of communication, level of peer review, fixable, etc)
4. we need to combine the above lists
5. reach some conclusion and recommendation, to support better science and move away from "bullied into bad science"

## How

Well, I need to think about that... watch this space.
